<h5>NORA.</h5>
Sleep well, Doctor Rank.

<h5>RANK.</h5>
<p>Thank you for that wish.</p>

<h5>NORA.</h5>
<p>Wish me the same.</p>

<h5>RANK.</h5>
<p>You? Well, if you want me to sleep well! And thanks for the light. <p>_[He
nods to them both and goes out.]_</p></p>

<h5>HELMER.</h5>
<p><p>_[in a subdued voice]_.</p> He has drunk more than he ought.</p>

<h5>NORA.</h5>
<p><p>_[absently]_.</p> Maybe. <p>_[HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of his pocket
and goes into the hall.]_</p> Torvald! what are you going to do there?</p>

<h5>HELMER.</h5>
<p>Emptying the letter-box; it is quite full; there will be no room to put
the newspaper in tomorrow morning.</p>
